# SwiftDSA

SwiftDSA is a Swift Package that provides implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms in Swift. It serves as a reference resource for developers looking to understand and utilize efficient data structures and algorithms in their Swift projects. 

## Features

- Implementations of common data structures (e.g., linked lists, trees, graphs)
- Various algorithm implementations (e.g., sorting, searching, graph algorithms)
- Thoroughly tested with Swift Testing framework
- Performance benchmarks using ordo-one/package-benchmark

## Installation

Add SwiftDSA to your project using Swift Package Manager:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/yourusername/SwiftDSA.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

## Testing

Tests are including, using the Swift Testing framework. 

## Benchmarks

I hope to add benchmarks in the future using `ordo-one/package-benchmark`.
